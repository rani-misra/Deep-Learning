I had the parillada tonight which is essentially fajitas without the tortillas, which was strange. Needless to say, I ordered a side of tortillas. I liked that they had a veggie option of saitan for an extra $1.50, but also found it strange that the default meat for the dish was beef but if you wanted chicken it was an also an extra $1.50! Not that it's necessarily gone downhill over the years, but it has definitely changed... Just not sure yet if it's for the better.

One of the worst places I have been to in Philly (subtract 1.5 stars).   Yeah its a casual dining place and I am not expecting professional waiters\/waitresses.  Still, it shouldn't take 15 minutes to get water and for somebody to come around to get your order.  That's pathetic.  \n\nFood was terribly slow too.  Again, it took more than 30 minutes once the order was in.  It wasn't our table either.  The other tables around us took nearly as long\/if not longer.  \n\nIt shouldn't take more than 30 minutes at a Mexican\/Tex-Mex restaurant  to take the order, cook the food, and plate the food for a table of 6.  If I had done that in my days as a line guy, the sous chef or head chef would have been in my face for the rest of the night.  My bet is that they need a better system with a more experienced expediter to bark at people as needed.     \n\nGood luck trying to get the waitress to come back once your food is served too.  You should either bring a foghorn or a flare gun.  I would go with the former.\n\nAs for the food, it is was an eclectic mix of Tex-Mex and Mexican.    Some decent choices and most people were pretty satisfied but the restaurant should really pick one cuisine (Tex-Mex or Mexican) and really focus on it solely.  Maybe that is just a personal preference after living in CA and traveling to TX so much.\n\nVerdict - I would go back here again for the food but not until the service improves or go on an off-night.  The service is just horrendous on a busy night (Thurs-Sat).","predicted_text":"Negative"},{"name":"Tacodelphia","text":"Great food for the price!

The reviews seemed okay and everyone said that the drinks were really good. \n\nNot at all true....\n\nTo start with, we ordered the guacamole. I have had a lot of different kinds and make it myself at home, and this was incredibly bland with not a lot of flavor.  I ordered the Carnitas Tacos and my boyfriend got the Brisket Tacos (special of the day). They were all right, but the waiter told us right off the bat he would recommend a side since they were small portions.  We didn't end up eating any of our side since they were so big, we each only finished two tacos! \n\nThe most disappointing part of this whole experience was the drinks.  I got the Classic Mojito (which I have also had and made many times before) and he got the Mexican style Mojito, that apparently is with cilantro and tequilla instead of rum and mint.  The first batch were really delicious, so we ordered another round. Not at ALL the same drink.  They looked very different, but mainly they didn't taste at all similar.  Very very sweet and acidic, way too bitter.  We politely called the waiter over and asked if the bartender wouldn't mind remaking them since the first drinks we had were very different, and he obliged. A few seconds later the bartender came back and told us she remade the drinks but tasted them and they tasted exactly how they should be.  She was very condescending and rude (My boyfriend and I have both worked in customer service before...when customers are being polite in their complaints, there is no need to be rude back) and said she would make the drink for us 10 times if we wanted but it wouldn't be any different. She said that they first AMAZING drink we had must have been made wrong.  She kept asking us how they were different and we had trouble explaining to her exactly what to change, so we decided to let it go and asked for the check. Yes, we still got charged for the shitty drinks that we left on our table. \n\nFor a tequilla bar who is apparently known for their drinks, the inconsistency is frightening.  I was very disappointed in the entire experience, not what I was planning for the first birthday that my boyfriend and I spent together.","predicted_text":"Negative"},{"name":"El Camino Real","text":"El Camino Real is my favorite go-to place.

One of my favorite dishes ever. \nThe Mexican Corn: Woah. Now that's good corn.

Second, my first choice on the menu wasn't available (the last two were served moments before). I'm not a restaurant manager, but running out of a dish before lunch (let alone dinner) is finished seems to be problematic. One plus are the free chips and salsa verde as soon as you sit down.\n\nThe food came out quickly. I ended up with a dish with rice and pan-seared shrimp, along with caramelized mixed veggies. Everything was acceptable, but I can't rave about anything. The portions could have been a bit bigger. Dan went with marinated beef tips, with refried beans and avocado. He said that the meat wasn't the best cut, and it marinade could have been improved upon.

I heard a lot about this place and wanted to try it so the food was pretty good it has a great mixture of authentic and Tex mex but overall it wasn't bad if I lived in this neighborhood this would be my favorite Mexican spot not getaway lol....I ordered basically a carne Asada with rice and beans the steak was to die for I wish is wasn't well done because it would be a little bit better but the flavor was excellent that was my favorite dish of the night. My Bf had a burrito I believe it could have been better but it was pretty packed and he was full.   My all time favorite of the night was the dessert we shared a \"tres Leche cake\" I'm pretty sure that was the wrong name but Im close and I have pictures so you will see.... this cake was amazing!! It was a little dry at the top but they basically had like a homemade whipped cream for the top which was amazing and the best part was the bottom which was very moist that held the three different types of milk on the bottom. I would share the secret but I was told not too lol you just have to try it! I would say that this place can deserve five stars but they have to work on some their waitress staff so these stars I put was for my overall experience. 3 stars for the overall experience 4 stars for\nThe cake!","predicted_text":"Positive"},{"name":"Cucina Zapata","text":"As soon as this food truck moved into \"food truck alley\" at Drexel, it became my favorite.

Truth be told, I've never eaten from a chuck wagon, but I do know my BBQ and can call this authentically delicious from at least twenty paces. \n\nPricing seemed high on some items which I only realized when I was served a burrito less than the size of your average newborn. And while I loved the divided menu, I would have liked to see some fusion dishes that marry the two ideas together. \n\nWe hit up the happy hour for half price marg pitchers were tasty. Not sure if it was because of happy hour, there was a ton of ice in the pitcher delivered to our table. \n\nThe atmosphere like the food is lively and varied. ECR is a great place to grab some drinks with a small group of friends or meet up with co-workers for some happy hour fun. \n\nCouldn't give this place a 4\/5 star review because in comparison with the Cantina, this place is just ok. Two things that stuck out were the ice to drink ratio and the fact they charge for chips and salsa. It's only a dollar for all you can eat, but still it seems cheap. Why charge at all? Or why charge for the first basket. Those two things combined made me wonder what else they are cheaping out on. \n\nTL;DR Great drinks; decent food.

Sweet. Xochitl (so-cheet) is located in the middle of the pretty cusp of Old City and Society Hill. I love this quaint little place. We went for restaurant week and despite what some here on the yelp say the service was not scaled back. \n\nThe hostess was very friendly, seated up promptly and took our jackets. I wasn't expecting a coat check. +1 for a great hostess and a coat check. It was cold as shit and I personally hate having to sit with my jacket pushed against my back. \n\nWe started with an awesome red sangria (it has tequila in it! w00t!) and they brought out some fresh baked warm and toasty bread (possibly the Xochitl take on pan de agua), with some regular butter and some sp!cy butter. At this point I was already head-over-heels.\n\nXochitl really went all out this year for restaurant week. Instead of the standard 3 courses for $35 Xochitl offers 4 courses for the same price. That earned them another +1. I started with the pollo con vegetales soup and it was a delight. My fianc\u00e9e had the corn soup with truffles and goat cheese. She won. That soup knocked my socks off and I want to go home and make it. \n\nNext up for me was the seafood ceviche. It was served tapas style on little fried corn cakes. There was one of each (Spanish mackerel, octopus, and shrimp) and they were tasty. I used to be the anti-ceviche guy, but after having great experiences at two places now, I am sold.  \n\nMain course is always my favorite course. I ordered the skirt steak medium and it came out medium. +1. It seems no one ever gets my steak right, but tonight Xochitl was running on all fours. The skirt was topped with a special salsa and had a side of pureed turnips. Everything on the plate complemented each other which of coarse is the way it's supposed to be. Often times when a sauce is added to a skirt, it's used to mask the quality of the beef. This was not the case. I tasted every flavor that this dish offered and there I decided that this place wasn't going to do me wrong.\n\nDessert: Churros w\/ two pudding style dipping sauces. I was wow'd. I mean a churro isn't really anything special, and I am not really a dessert guy, but they were warm, tasty, and the little bit of chocolate dip was a great finish to a wonderful dining experience. \n\nXochitl earned itself a good 5 star rating from me. Ambiance was great, food was great, server was friendly, host was on point... It feels great to try out a new restaurant and be impressed. $35 for four courses makes it feel even better.","predicted_text":"Positive"},{"name":"4 Seasons Grill Mexican Restaurant","text":"Food quality depends on the day.

While we didnt end up staying for an actual dinner, we did order some drinks and share a few items off the menu to hold us over. Heres the long and the short...\n\nThe mushroom\/artichoke flatbread was visually appealing but somewhat bland. Short rib tamale wasnt exactly a tamale as it was a pile of short rib on top of a few masa medallions. To their credit, the short rib itself was tasty, but the dish was so over-engineered I wish it just came wrapped in a damn corn husk. \nOur favorite was the carnitas tacos. Easily among the most flavorful and well executed carnitas I've had in a long time. Tender shredded pork finish fried to a crisp, served on proper corn tortillas with diced onions and cilantro. Thats the one thing I would come back for (at the moment).  I only wish they werent so damn small, especially for $12. \n\nOverall, it would seem all the right elements are in place for a successful contemporary mexican restaurant - picturesque location, competant bar with heavy pours, and some decent flavor coming out of the kitchen. So why the 2 stars? My biggest gripes are with the tapas sized dishes with entree sized prices, and the hit-or-miss service. In our circumstance, our wait staff seemed to alternate between the manager on duty and a roving waiter, neither of which was sure who was responsible for our table. Also, we ordered 2 mojitos when we sat down... they were the last and only drinks to hit our table for the duration of our meal, despite being finished before the food ever got there.

What I like about the food trucks at Drexel is that they are priced to not interfere with students' tight food budget. They are priced not high or low, but definitely cheaper than a lot food vendors that is owned by the school or neighboring stores like Shake Shack, Cozara, and etc. Another thing I like about Cucinas is the friendly staff, creativity, and uniqueness of the food they make for the customers. \n\nCucina Zapata features a fusion of Thai and Mexican, such as tacos, burrito, katsu, bubble tea, and much more. The first I recommend is the satay chicken soft tacos (1 for $3, 2 for $6, 3 for $8) because I know they can get me full. The lettuce, the peanut sauce, spicy mayo, chicken, and the soft taco; the combination is amazing and the taste when it enters in your mouth is so satisfying. The second thing I would recommend is the Captain Crunch Tilapia Burrito. I know right..just the name of the food gives you wonder and joy. The tilapia's crunchy coat (Captain Crunch cereal) is the key and what makes this burrito delicious. The third thing is the Chicken Katsu. For just $6, this dish is packed with so much flavor: spicy mayo and siracha. This is definitely a must get!\n\nOn top of this, the tea here is a bit better than other popular locations, such as Tea Do and Kung Fu Tea. I love the homemade thai tea or taro tea and definitely recommend others to get this if you love this curiously orange colored tea with bubbles. After ordering these food that Cucina offers, not only it tasted so good consistently, but also I was able to tell about the creativity: it's Cucina's strong suit. \n\nThere are so many food trucks on campus, but Cucina Zapata is no doubt my top three most favorite food truck at Drexel University campus.","predicted_text":"Positive"},{"name":"Buena Onda","text":"Possibly the best fish tacos I've ever had.

To Penn students - it is worth the hike!\n\nMy favorite order, and the most famous one, is the Capn' Crunch Tilapia Burrito, consisting of lettuce, tomato, avocado, and two big slabs of cereal-encrusted fish, all covered in sriracha mayo and bundled in a flour tortilla. As weird as it sounds, the breading only imparts a slightly sweet touch while still giving the fish a satisfying crunch. The mix of textures and flavors in this burrito is amazing!\n\nAnother classic order is their twist on chicken katsu, a sizeable breaded chicken cutlet (but not with Capn' Crunch) served with rice and salad. It comes topped with that yummy spicy mayo, and a more traditional brown savory sauce with sprinkles of dry seaweed. Once again, what a great combo of textures and flavors! \n\nI once tried their chicken satay platter, since I'm a fan of those skewers in most Southeast Asian restaurants. The meat was dry for my liking, but the peanut sauce was as good as any. I tried getting the peanut sauce on my katsu once for kicks - nice that they let you customize.\n\nLast but not least, the Thai tea! Wonderfully sweet and milky while still having a deep tea flavor.

Chips were unlimited and came with salsa verde as well. The chips are very filling so be sure to save room for whatever you plan on ordering. The guac portions were also pretty large, so in the future I do think one order would be fine for four people.\n\nI then ordered the seitan tacos, which were excellent.

In general, prices have increased but the value has not. A recent dinner with three girlfriends, with an order of guac, three entrees and one drink each, cost us more than $150 and we each left hungry. The highly touted fried chicken was lackluster and the camarones con caldo, while cooked well, wasn't balanced in its seasoning.

Five of us ordered the Cap'n Crunch Tilapia Burritos, while one ordered the Chicken Satay taco and also requested for the Chicken Katsu platter to be served as a taco instead of a platter.  The food presentation was impressive.  The burritos were wrapped securely; hardly any of its contents fell out.  The tacos looked amazing as well.  I had the Cap'n Crunch Tilapia Burrito myself and thought it was one of the best fish burritos I've ever had.  The fish was cooked perfectly (with a very subtle crunch on the outside) and the sauce used had a subtle kick to it.  One co-worker generally hates spicy foods, but she really enjoyed the Cap'n Crunch Tilapia Burritos and noted that the sauce was at a comfortable level of spice for her.  My co-workers were very pleased that I brought them to Cucina Zapata and thought the food was delicious.  Everyone devoured their food, leaving no leftovers.  To add to that, the Cucina Zapata team was very friendly and attentive, especially when there were six of us that ordered as a group and a line of other hungry patrons eagerly waiting their turn to order.

We respond \"sure, no problem\" and her smugness indicated that perhaps she wanted us scared away (the actual wait was more like 20 min, not bad).\n\nAnyway, we pay and grab some counter seating.  Food comes and presentation wise, looks great.  I got one carnitas taco, one chicken and one batter fried fish taco.  Also ordered nachos for the group.\n\nCarnitas: Phenomenal.  This should be the go to.\nChicken: Marginal (so much sauce, would've been nice to know it was Tinga style)\nFish: Marginal (soggy fish despite fried, way too much sauce\/crema)\n\nThe overall theme of the chicken and fish was way too much sauce.  Ton of crema, ton of tinga sauce (or whatever it is the chicken is cooked in).  It's like I ordered crema tacos with a spritz of fish and chicken.  No complaints about the carnitas, this was amazing.\n\nThe nachos were not brought out with the original food so I asked about them.  The manager asked the chef who hurried to the oven and pulled out the severely overcooked nachos, which were left in there at least 15 minutes too long.  As the manager and chef talked, I could see the chef through the open kitchen laughing at the state of these nachos, then watched that despite his laughter, he prepped with salsa and about half a gallon of crema (so much crema) and actually served them to us.  As expected, they were forgettable.\n\nOverall, just okay.  Carnitas is money, they need to seriously ease up on the crema (lest they change their name to broadcast their love and heavy handed use of crema) and don't serve burnt nachos to customers.\n\nProbably going to be a while until I return.

I was looking for a fun and festive place to go with friends.  This was the perfect choice. We brought our own bottle of tequila, and they made tasty margaritas for the table.  Those were a big hit with my friends, and a cool twist for a Mexican BYOB.  The restaurant is cute.  Plus, the food here is delicious. \n\nI'm surprised this place doesn't have higher reviews on Yelp, because it far exceeded my expectations... \n\nThe guacamole appetizer was fresh and yummy.  I ordered the shrimp entree with rice and vegetables, and asked for it spicy.  My entr\u00e9e had an attractive presentation on the plate (i.e. looked classy), and was delicious, well seasoned, and very fresh. On my suggestion, my partner ordered one of their mole sauce dishes (i.e. a sauce usually made from unsweetened chocolate and pureed pumpkin seeds), and it was tasty too. \n\nI should also note that the waitress was very attentive.  When I placed my order, I explained to her that I have mild lactose intolerance and can't eat much butter or cream (but am okay with cheese), so she had the chef cook the veggies in olive oil, rather than butter.  Thanks for being so cool about accommodating that request!  \n\nThe prices are extremely reasonable for fancy and unusual Mexican food, and I love the fact they're a BYOB.  The chef serves creative and inspired cuisine, which has a traditional flair and style to it.  In other words: Don't come here for regular tacos or burritos.  Come here for a fun foodie experience at a reasonable price, and bring tequila for the perk of BYOB Margaritas!","predicted_text":"Positive"},{"name":"Parada Maimon","text":"Friendly staff and great legit Dominican food.

Aside from a decent brunch, not really anything to write home about. When talking about Mexican options in Manayunk, I usually describe it as the following - if you want GOOD Mexican, go to Taqueria Feliz. If you want BAR Mexican, go to Cactus. Bar Mexican I think is a pretty good description.\n\nThe times I've been here, it's never been outwardly horrible, but never really good either. Went here last night with some friends. The place was not even half full and we were sat in the back of the first floor. Which that's not a big deal at all, but it was no excuse for our server to be MIA through much of our meal. We were right next to the computer station and even when we were trying to get her attention for the check when she was standing RIGHT THERE, she would ignore us and run off. \n\nThe margaritas are a ripoff. We all realized we were ordering the same margarita type so we were like let's just get a pitcher. We asked how many drinks you got out of a pitcher and she told us 4-5. How many did we actually get? 3. We got 3 margaritas for the 3 of us. $28 pitcher. I'm sure you can do the math and realize that is a few bucks more per margarita than if we had just ordered them individually. \n\nThe food is alright. I mean, you by no means go here for a killer meal. You go here if you want cheap decent Mexican-like food. Their specials are pretty good - we all did the $6 quesadilla. I had the steak and it was good. Not amazing, but good. \n\nThey do have a lengthy tequila menu so if tequila is your thing, this may be a good stop. But don't waste your $$ on the pitchers of margaritas. I mean, I don't mind paying top dollar for a GOOD margarita but like other reviews have stated, their margs are all mix.\n\nWill I be back? Sure, if I'm with people that want to go.

They came out piled high, sans beans, covered in all fatty pieces of brisket and topped with a bag of lettuce. The cheese was tasted like a liquid version of mayo. Let's just say they were bad. So, when she finally came around 16 minutes later, I apologized and told her they were really gross.

I ordered one short rib taco and one chicken satay taco along with a Thai iced tea. I was absolutely delighted when I cracked open my styrofoam box: two pretty sizeable tacos with giant slices of fresh avocado smiling up at me! Aesthetically beautiful and delicious too. I found the short rib taco to be better than the chicken satay, which was a little on the dry side. The Thai iced tea was also a little too sweet, so I would recommend specifically asking for it to be made less sweet. However, the short rib taco was incredibly juicy, tender, and well-seasoned.

The chicken's dry rub was good, but the protein itself was cooked to a consistency that one might call \"slimy.\" The seitan on the other hand was nicely flavored and crispy. We also had chips and salsa, which any Mexican restaurant should be able to do. It came with 2 salsas: smoked and verde. The verde was an abomination: ground up tomatillos...no salt, no spices. The \"smoked\" one was far from smoked- just chopped tomatoes, onions and a bit of cilantro and salt (essentially a basic pico de gallo found at a condiment bar like Fuddruckers). I ordered from the \"Texas\" menu with the wagyu beef brisket and ribs with spicy sauce. The sauce was good, and the meat was smoky,moist,and mostly acceptable. The brisket however was very fatty. My boyfriend ordered an $11 barbacoa burrito and upgraded to the plato for an extra $5. When one thinks of a $16 burrito meal you'd imagine a formidably sized  Mexican wrap with all the fixins. This alleged burrito turned out to be two finger-sized tortillas (slightly larger than a 7-11 taquito) with a tablespoon each of what tasted like dry shredded pemmican meat crammed into only one end of each little tube. There was nothing else in these odd little \"burritos\"- quite literally, the only ingredient beside the meat was a flour tortilla. The rice and beans addition to this \"meal\" were mushy, unseasoned, and revolting in appearance, texture and flavor.\n\nThat being said, the meat dishes there are passably executed, but the price tag should command a higher level of quality for everything on the plate (and some sides should be included). If you are not a tasteless aging hipster sheep, and must still go to this place for whatever reason, I suggest you order an all-meat item from the Texas side of the menu.\n\n* Pros: mostly good smoked meat, decent atmosphere if you don't mind hipsters\n* Cons: service (extremely slow), value, food selection, \"Mexican\" menu","predicted_text":"Negative"},{"name":"El Camino Real","text":"Lots of really great food on the menu.

We both like different food, and we both were off work! \nSurprisingly, I didn't see the long line everyone had promised. There were two other people there, and they had to have been regulars, because I noticed the owner of the truck was talking to them by name. When I tell you HE IS THE NICEST GUY EVER, I MEAN IT, lol.  He talked to us about work, other food trucks, and his family.

I shook mine up a bit, and took a sip from the top. The first words out of my mouth were \"what in the devil is this nectar?!?!\"\nI didn't MEAN to sound like Will Ferrell, but the tea was making me do it. \n15 minutes later, we had arrived to the house, and we excitedly sat our trays down, snapping giddy fat pictures of our food pre-nosh.

The way I could describe it is a little spicy, a tad bit sweet, and nutty. You can taste the peanut, with the avocado, the chicken, tomato, that spicy house sauce...they layered the hell out of those flavors. Every bite was different, but they all worked together. I looked down, and the first one I was eating was the Chicken Satay. It was sincerely amazing. I grabbed a fork, and practically went face first into the little hill of rice, chicken, sweet potato, and curry sauce that sat before me.

However, being that it was a Friday night around 8 and the place was extremely crowded, we decided to call in a takeout order.  This is the reason I was hesitant on how to rate it, takeout is typically never quite as tasty as when you eat in the restaurant, at least not from my experience.  Anyway, he ordered pork belly and pork spare ribs and I ordered the Tex Cobb salad, we shared the smoked chicken wings.  I did not like the chicken wings at all, there was something about the meat that I just found gross.  He thought the pork spare ribs were just okay and as he was eating, muttered something about them changing the pork belly since the last time he was there, and he liked it better before.  However, I did really enjoy the Tex Cobb salad.  I actually found myself wanting to order it again a few nights later, though I didn't.  It comes topped with bacon, pork shoulder, and smoked turkey, amongst other things. Though I did have to pick out a few pieces of pork shoulder and bacon that I didn't like the looks of, I though the smoked turkey was damn tasty.  All in all, it was a really decent salad.  Would I frequent this place, no, but I would consider giving the salad another try.","predicted_text":"Positive"},{"name":"El Camino Real","text":"I have never had anything here I don't like!! Food is fantastic.\n\nHowever, once I had the enchiladas (almost two years ago) they're ALL I ORDER.  Ive had them with shrimp, chicken, steak, and chili.  (All on separate occasions of course.) The enchiladas with texas chili is my fav and its served with a fried dippy egg on top.  AMAZE.  \nThe guac is also awesome. And endless chips and salsa for $1.00 per person is pretty rad. In the summer I usually get their pitchers of sangria (for two of us) and at $30- its a great deal.\n\nStaff is always super laid back, friendly, and attentive.   \n\nLOVE the outside seating.

There's a reason this place hidden in a Drexel alleyway has received so much attention as of late...it's THAT good!  I noticed that today their prices had gone up by $1 for the Chicken Satay Tacos, only about a month ago they were $5 and now they're $6.  Still worth it in my opinion but the $1 increase is just at the far end of what's affordable for me.

The $10 coupon for a return trip is a good idea, and I will definitely be back.

I'm from San Diego originally, and she is from Central California, and her dad's family is Mexican. That being said, Las Cazuelas is definitely one of the best Mexican restaurants we have found on the East Coast in terms of authentic flavors. We've been there twice now from brunch, and last night was the first time we went for dinner.\n\nDinner was amazing - I got the Mole Poblano, which is probably the best Mole that I have ever had. My wife said it tasted exactly like the Mole that she used to have when she was staying with a family in Ensanada, Mexico. She had a chicken in a special Guajillo chile sauce that was incredibly rich but super delicious.\n\nBrunch both times we have gone blew our socks off. Also, don't miss out on the coffee! Their cafe au lait is superb, and the cafe de olla reminds me exactly of the coffee at a little Mexican place in San Diego that I went when I was young. \n\nSo why only 4 stars? The entree prices for dinner are a little steep. If you go, definitely use a Yelp deal, living social, etc. Brunch prices are right on the money (and portions are huge!), lunch prices seem right, it's just dinner that's a little steep. Granted, the portions are extremely generous (my wife had a full dinner and two lunch portions left to take to work this week), but instead of $16-20, I would expect to see more like $10-16 for dinner prices at a location like this. \n\nWe'll definitely be returning for brunch very soon!","predicted_text":"Positive"},{"name":"El Camino Real","text":"My ideal way to enjoy El Camino: Go in with a couple of friends on a weeknight, sit at the bar, order from the Texas side of the menu. \n\nThe pig wings are amazing!

The brisket hash, seriously, will cure every hangover ever. There are really extensive selections of tequila and whiskey, if you're into that kind of thing. They also have one of my favorite beers on tap- Lancaster Milk Stout!\n\nI've found that you get your food faster and hotter when you sit at the bar. Also, the bar service is wonderful.

I ordered a chicken burrito and it came wrapped up in two separate tortillas that looked like skinny, flat Taco Bell tacos and it came with some pathetic small salad. STILL HUNGRY! We had to go get a slice of pizza afterward.\n\nMy friends were equally disappointed, if not more and the waitress was a total bitch! She brought us all water with loads of ice except for my one friend who happen to be African American. Coincidence? I wouldn't put it past her since her attitude was so shitty. It also took her about 15 minutes to get our orders & then we waited painfully long after that for the food to actually arrive.\n\nThanks a lot El Camino \"Real\"... up the food, get better servers, & maybe I'll come back.","predicted_text":"Negative"},{"name":"El Camino Real","text":"It pains me to write this review as I was a big supporter of El Camino - but last night both my boyfriend and I got food poisoning after eating here.

At most places,  I load on the hot sauce.  So I assumed when I got the arroz con pollo with chicken, rice, and mexican sauage (which was delicious) that it wouldn't be spicy enough.  I so stupidly didn't even taste it and asked for some hot sauce, which they brought me in a dish.  It looked like Franks Red Hot, so I dumped it on.  Big mistake.  The hot sauce was SO SPICY (which unbeknownst to me, they charged me $1 for).  It was so hot that I downed 5 glasses of water, had tears in my eyes, and couldn't finish the rest of my meal.  On the plus side, I was stuffed from water and hence, didn't overeat!\n\nThe service here is really fantastic.  The server was so friendly and kept our water glasses filled.  We had a groupon ($15 for $30) and although it didn't say it on the groupon, the server told us that it came with a free dessert!  We got the crepes with bananas, caramel, and fresh berries which was tasty.   You also get free chips and tomatillo sauce, which was great.

Always get the mexi($6) which has pork carnitas, sweet potato, guac, sour cream, beans, and rice with hot and yogurt tomatillo sauces. The yogurt tomatillo sauce adds a creaminess and fresh, light flavor that tops off these amazing burritos. They grill your burrito again at the end to make sure it's toasty and your cheese is melted.

However they were able to seat us at a small table in the bar area. It worked out for the best because we were able to get the happy hour specials. I had a couple margaritas and they were really fantastic. They were definitely fresh. \n\nFor an appetizer we had one of the guacamole specials that included pine nuts and cilantro. It was mouth watering. It they would have handed me a vat full of it and a spatula I would have polished it off. My only gripe about it at check time is that it cost $13, when regular tableside guac cost $8. Next time I think we'll just go with the traditional guacamole. \n\nFor dinner I had the Bistec Azteca, which was a skirt steak with avocado fries. The steak was tender and delicious, although not remarkable. The star of the show was the avocado fries. Seriously. Why have I never had this before? Why have I never made this before? The hot avocado inside the fried outside was creamy and absolutely phenomenal. Thinking of it right now is making me hungry. Truly the star of the night. \n\nMy husband had the pork tenderloin. Of the two meats I preferred his, the seasoning was strong, and I definitely recommend. \n\nFor dessert we had churros with chocolate dipping sauce.

There was some kind of creamy corn sauce on the chips. The first couple of bites tasted great but my stomach felt like lead after 3 chips. These nachos are loaded and the \"small\" portion is huge. It also looked like there was an entire pint of sour cream dumped on top of the nachos. Four friends couldn't finish half of the dish.\n\nCactus nachos weren't bad, but I'd never make the trek out to Manayunk just to eat there.

However, I do have to hand it to their incredibly friendly owner, Tony; when he found out what happened, he offered us two rounds of shots on the house.

We logged a lot of miles in 2 days and tried as many food trucks as we could. Now this was no willy nilly ride-stop eat at any truck-type excursion. I did weeks of Yelp research and narrowed it down to six places and we  achieved our gastronomic goal. Well, as \nmuch as I really liked every other place, and even gave some of them 5 stars.... this place was mind-blowing!!! How do these 3 guys manage to make this food so damn flavorful and fresh and exciting in that little space?! No clue but I'm beyond impressed. We had the short rib taco, the Cap'n Crunch tilapia burrito and the chicken satay taco. ALL were special: they had what tasted like a sriracha\/mayo drizzle and all had beautiful fresh perfect pieces of avocado on them. The short ribs was husband's favorite, followed by the tilapia burrito, but he loved them all. I loved the satay chicken taco. Now have never been a meat eater. I've been to  steak houses around the US as well as abroad...Butcher & Singer, Palm, DelFriscos, Peter Lugers ..and I have left each one without being convinced to taste one bite of steak\/pork\/veal\/foie gras\/etc. Well not sure what got into me but the short rib taco smelled so otherworldly that I took a bite. One word- PHENOMENAL!!! I cannot wait to go back. In fact, we live an hour away and we have planned a repeat trip on Friday!!!","predicted_text":"Positive"},{"name":"Xochitl","text":"Tucked into a small storefront on Headhouse Square at Second and Lombard, just off of South Street and next to the Artful Dodger, you'll find Xochitl, one of Philly's hottest new restaurants.  Xochitl, pronounched \"so-sheet,\" is named after an ancient Aztec queen, and I can only describe the fare as Latin American fusion.  And it is to-die-for.\n\nI recommend starting your meal with the fresh guacamole made right at your table.   It is the single most delicious guacamole you will ever eat, and you will find yourself scraping the bottom of the bowl in order to get every last scrap of it.  At least that's what I did.  Following the guacamole and chips, I highly recommend the scallops and watermelon ceviche, which is on permanent special.  While the combination of watermelon with shellfish may sound unusual, I guarantee that the thinly sliced scallops placed atop fresh, sweet watermelon and topped with microgreens will be the most unexpected and heavenly flavor combination that you've ever tasted.\n\nOnce you've recovered from the mouth-watering appetizers, you will find that the entrees are just as delightful.  All of the varieties of ceviche served at Xochitl are delicious, and I especially liked their ceviche tostadas.  Another scrumptious dish is the poblano pepper stuffed with ground meat and topped with a vanilla walnut sauce.  If you prefer something else, Xochitl's menu is packed with creative concoctions featuring seafood, chicken, goat meat, and other proteins with spicy vegetable combinations.  The entire menu is featured online at www.xochitlphilly.com, except for the specials, so you can even make your decision before you arrive.\n\nIf you still have room for dessert after your meal, you will have difficulty choosing just one item from the dessert menu.  I was too stuffed when I went there, so I opted for the Mexican hot chocolate, which was rich, creamy, and had the slightest hint of some sort of pepper.  My boyfriend and I were there for my birthday, and I suppose that I confounded his plans because I ordered hot chocolate instead of a solid dessert, but the waitress was so sweet that she stuck a lit birthday candle onto the hot chocolate's saucer.  If that's not personalized service, I don't know what is!\n\nIn addition to the wonderful food, Xochitl also serves a variety of tequilas and other drinks that you will find appealing.  The tequilas are their specialty, and you can order a sampler flight of three from their extensive tequila menu.  You can also order tequila in cucumber shot glasses.  They also have margaritas, Mexican beer, and other alcoholic beverages.  My favorite drink, however, is their slightly sweet hibiscus-infused water.  If you are adventurous, I suggest their spicy beer concoction, which mixes beer with tomato juice and other spices.\n\nFinally, Xochitl's charming atmosphere and decor combines with its menu to make it one of the hippest new restaurants in Philly.  The cozy upstairs features a full bar area and a dining area, complete with the type of candle-lit decor one might imagine is featured in the old grand haciendas of Zorro's days.  If you go downstairs, you'll find another full bar and charming lounge area, where you can order drinks and food, and the entire atmosphere there is reminiscent of being on a starlight veranda.  The walls are a deep blue, the lighting is low, the couches are comfy, and candlelight twinkles off of mirrors all around you.\n\nI highly recommend making reservations if you intend to go for dinner because seating in the dining area is limited, and this place is becoming ever more popular by the minute.\n\nIn all, I would say this is one place that  everyone in Philadelphia ought to try.\n\nUPDATE:  I've been here several times now, and I love this place more and more.  Everything I've had is always perfect, so I'm convinced the chef is a genius.  They also often run specials, like 4-course meals for $35.  The most recent special is the Frida Kahlo menu, which will run until the Frida show at the Art Museum closes on May 18, and which features recipes stolen from Frida's own recipe box (and, I'm sure, improved by the chef - it was all amazingly delicious).  Seriously, the chef there has a real knack for creating perfectly balanced dishes with delicate flavors and mind-blowing delectability.  Take, for example, some of his soups, which come with the ingredients in the bowl, and the broth is poured in at the table, with fresh onions and cilantro on the side.  Pure heaven.","predicted_text":"Positive"},{"name":"Cucina Zapata","text":"This little food truck is not always known to everyone but one of the best food trucks I've gone to.\n\nWhat's good:\nThe tilapia burrito with the sauce it's provided with\nThe rice bowls\nThe tacos\nPretty much anything on the menu is good\n\nTips:\nLines are pretty long at meal times\nLike most food trucks, they take only cash\n\nAnecdote:\nOne time I brought an entire Penn freshman hall here because I like it so much, and the cook gave me a free Pellegrino lemon soda.","predicted_text":"Positive"},{"name":"Tacodelphia","text":"OMGeeee...I was starved and saw Illegal Tacos.

In general, the fried fish\/shrimp tacos are the way to go.  I wouldn't recommend their meat tacos.\n\nThe fried fish tacos are pretty good.  Not as good as what you can find in southern California (where I grew up).  And about half the size.  For about 1.5x the price.  But still pretty good, especially for Philadelphia.  I think it's because they do the batter well.  I don't understand why people like grilled fish tacos, but if that floats your boat, then go for it.\n\nThe meat tacos are not good.  I'm all for quality ingredients, but I draw the line at trying to yuppify a classic.  C'mon, you can't serve a taco without cilantro, raw onions, and lime.\n\nThey talk about making the tortillas fresh, but by the time the food comes out, the tortillas are not warm, nor is the fish\/meat inside.  Maybe that's just because they seemed to have some service issues though.\n\nIt's the first week, so I'm sure things will get better.  But we did not enjoy the ambiance in there.  It was like trying to shop at a Trader Joe's the night before a snow storm, right down to the huge line snaking around everywhere, with workers and customers all trying to squeeze past each other.\n\nMeh.","predicted_text":"Neutral"},{"name":"El Camino Real","text":"Pulled pork.

My friends have gotten the tacos and said they were very good.

The first time this happened, I asked the server about it, and they stirred it up which solved the problem, and it came out delicious.

The beef brisket was delicious, but the other parts of the taco (pickled veggies) were not good. I would definitely recommend going there for happy hour, though, since they seem to have some great deals (although be sure to sit at the bar - happy hour specials are not available for sit down service).","predicted_text":"Neutral"},{"name":"El Camino Real","text":"Maybe we got lucky with the server, but the litany of complaints about the service didn't reflect a recent Friday night experience. \n\nEndless chips and salsa, plus side o' guacamole, came out fast and were joined by a couple of fine craft brews (small but good selection). The guac, pico de gallo and salsa verde were all good, and they rub a bit of spice on the chips for extra kick, which was a nice touch. Is there a better app for $4 within a 3-mile radius? Probably not, but you tell me.\n\nAs others have noted, the burritos aren't what many of us are used to. This isn't a Mission-style torpedo weighing in at 5 pounds, exploding out of the foil with a delectable mess of beans, rice, guac, sour cream plus the meat of your choice. No, it's not that at all. But that's okay. I didn't have any trouble embracing, then devouring, the two svelte carnitas-filled and un-grilled tortillas. I dressed 'em up in the guac and salsa and had no complaints. And I didn't even miss the overstuffed feeling that comes as the secret side with burritos gordos. \n\nMy vegan buddy had the veggie wings that everyone raves about, and the BBQ seitan. I tried them both, and liked them, but taking my advice on vegetarian\/vegan food is really a waste of all of our time, Mr. Spicoli. So take it from Vegan Mike: he loves them.  \n\nExcellent service throughout: attentive but not rushed. I don't know how some people got duped or upsold on the $5 rice and beans side. I know these are usually in the burrito, but the menu lists them separately with the price and indicates that they aren't ingredients in the burrito, so it was clear to me. Ambiance was nice and vibrant, and even though the place was busy, we got a booth right away. \n\nI'm trying to think of cons, but there really weren't any, so I'll be visiting again.

The first time I visited was with a group of of 7 for my birthday and it was great! The service was wonderful, they were prompt, accommodating and did not rush us at all. The only thing I wasn't crazy about the first time was the mole chicken enchiladas I got...I think I just didn't like the sauce but everyone else was happy with their meals. The last time we went which was last weekend was a bit different. Again it was 7 people and again for my birthday...the restaurant I had initially planned on was overbooked (not that I didn't wanna go here I was just trying to change it up) so Las Cazuelas was the only place that was able to make last minute accommodations for a party of 7 on a Saturday night (AND we were running late and they were super nice about it so props on both counts). However, I think they just got slammed because the waitress we had was sweet but all over the place. She checked in with us twice to get our order then disappeared for a while to the point where we had to flag someone down to get her to come back. It took about an hour for our food to come out and at the last minute before our food came out we were told they were out of crab so someone had to re-order (it ended up being a mix-up but still it was at least 45 minutes after we placed our order that they came out to tell us this). When they brought out the dishes they brought them out at all different times instead of together (like it was 10 minutes from when the first person received their food to the last person to get their's, and the last person had to inquire about it before someone brought it out) I really enjoyed my dish (I got the crab enchiladas) but a few people at my table weren't satisfied with theirs (meat was overcooked and someone else got the mole enchiladas which they didn't like either). \n\nOverall I like this place and may return again, the staff is extremely friendly and accommodating and for the most part the food is really good.

Not a huge fan of the nachos, by I'm probably biased because I went to college next to the best nacho restaurant in the country (in my opinion)! However, the totorilla chips tasted fresh and homemade. Could have used more cheese, one can never have too much. Also ordered the mac & cheese. The waiter pushed us to order chili with it, which ended up being completely unnecessary. The chili consists of huge chucks of beef, which was good but more like a side dish than combo. Maz & cheese was very good too. \n\nMy second visit was during Yelp cocktails week. $2.50 margaritas are hard to beat! They were very tasty, but more sryupy than I prefer. Our waitress was alright. We were a table of 7 and she kept forgetting one or two things. Wasn't a huge deal though. For my meal I had a steak burrito, which I thought was very tasty.

They were deliciously prepared and the (what I presume to be) homemade sauces provided great extra flavor. They also have Boylan's fountain soda which is really just to die for. \n\nAnd now, the airing of grievances (Seinfeld style):\n\n1. The tacos are pretty small considering the price (about 4 a pop). I guess that might be so you can sample a selection of the offerings but no one wants to feel they're not getting any bang for their buck. \n\n2. It doesn't seem like there's enough seating to accommodate a lunch crowd. The turnover was fast enough and it wasn't an issue for my crew of four but I could def see it being a problem. \n\n3. There's at least one discrepancy on the menu (tecate is either $2 everyday or $4.50 depending on where you see it) that annoys me because I think pricing should be straightforward and clear. It just seems to me the error allows for a loophole of charging customers more if they're not looking closely. \n\n4.  Lastly, the power situation. While we were there yesterday, there was a power outage. I'm in no way blaming that on Buena since it appeared to cover a few blocks in the surrounding area but, the way it was handled by the staff left a lot to be desired. Namely, they just said \"sorry folks\" and watched as diners attempted to wait it out or customers who hadn't placed orders yet filed out. I would've expected some sort of customer retention effort. After about 10 min of no power (windows allowed plenty of daylight to see), no updates, and increasing heat since the air conditioning was off, we left, too. \n\nTake away:: a good option if you're looking for a bite in the area, are not committed to eating in their dining area, and bring your reading glasses.","predicted_text":"Neutral"},{"name":"El Camino Real","text":"Stopped to eat here during the 2nd St festival.

I came for drinks with the possibility of getting food and they were difficult about giving me a table. There was no room at the bar, so they just expected me to stand the whole time. They finally sat me at a table, and evn though I ordered 50 dollars worth of drinks for 2 ppl, the waitress was snooty and ignored us. And then we decided to order wings and tacos and we couldn't even flag her down to order the food! And mind you, this was late at night, not during a dinner rush.

Not the case! We stumbled upon Xochitl and my boyfriend remembered hearing good things about it so in we went. We barely waited 3 minutes before being seated. Pretty decent given the circumstances. As it was restaurant week, Xochitl had a fixed 4 course menu at $35 a person. The meal started off with a customizable guacamole (we added red onion, roasted garlic, and cilantro) so yummy and the tortilla chips were perfectly crisp with just enough saltiness. Then on to the first course: we chose the cheese filled empanadas and some type of flat bread with mushrooms and cheese. I must admit that though good, the first courses were a tad bland. For example the flat bread could have used a little squeeze of citrus. For main courses, I ordered the short rib (served with a potato gordita and roasted veggies) and bf ordered the pollo frito (served with cornbread and greens) at the waiter's recommendation. The short rib was fantastic, perfectly glazed and tender but the potato and veggies were alittle lacking. I can't comment on the pollo frito but the cornbread it was served with was the best I've had yet. For dessert, we ordered the flan and doughnuts (served with both chocolate and strawberry dipping sauces). Both were very good. I also cannot comment on the drinks but if I visit again, I will most definitely give them a try. If you haven't been to Xochitl, I recommend giving it a go.","predicted_text":"Neutral"},{"name":"El Camino Real","text":"Came here twice in a month - on a Friday night and a Thursday evening before a long holiday weekend.

It was very fatty and there was very little meat.  \n\nThe banana pudding was mediocre - at $7, it was pricey for what you get.

Both were filled with delicious, fresh, and healthy-tasting ingredients. The green sauce on the tacos was awesome, and the avocado slices were a bonus. The breading on the fried tilapia wasn't so Cap'n Crunch tasting (I could be wrong, It's probably been about two decades since I've had Cap'n Crunch, and never in fried form), but it was still fantastic. The burrito is filling and a nice size for $6. \n\nThey don't open until noon, and I think they're usually swamped. Go on a cold day like we did, and the weather will hopefully keep the crowd (and the wait) under control. It's located at the very end of the hidden food truck alley at Drexel. Totally worth the trek, even from Penn. Also, the guy that takes orders is super friendly and tries to remember everyone's name.

I got eggs with beans and soft tortillas and the fake meat along with the vegan wings appetizer.  The wings are believable, and a little spicy.  The fake meat that came with my eggs tasted good combined with all the other stuff, and it was a good chewy and soft texture (not rubbery).  Though it wasn't that busy when we came, and it was practically empty inside, there was a wait list for tables outside, so we decided to just sit inside.

We didn't even get our margaritas until after we got our appetizer, and to make up for it, the waiter said he'd knock off the $2.50 charge for our chips and salsa (which, in my opinion, should already be free like in almost any other Mexican restaurant I've been to. Still, the place had just opened and I attributed the slow service to growing pains. My burrito was excellent.\n\nThe second time I went was for brunch.

There was lettuce in the burrito and he tasted sand. He went to the bathroom to wash his mouth out... yes it was that bad. I addressed the situation with the waitress and she took back the burrito and offered to make another one. We declined. You don't get do-overs for sandy lettuce. That is a clear indication of improper washing of food. \n\nThe bill finally came with the burrito still on it. I asked the waitress why it wasn't removed... she said she didn't have the power to and would address with her manager. Long story short... they decided not to remove the cost of a $12 burrito that was returned with more than 80% left. They decided they would comp the guacamole we ordered. Really El Camino... you were willing to remake the meal but wouldn't comp the meal?  Shame on your management staff for not knowing better!!!!!  We live in the neighborhood and will tell everyone this story. Restaurants make mistakes... we are reasonable people... your manager on duty failed BIG time for not removing the $12 burrito.

They were raw so they were crunchy and mushy at the same time. They were also tasteless and greasy and just plain EW. I had the Cobb salad which was gross because of the pork belly. It was straight chunks of uncooked pork fat (think bacon fat except an inch think and 2 inches long. And raw.). Pork belly is supposed to be cooked until it's crunchy, or so I thought. The hard boiled egg was doused in pepper and for the price, the tiny, greasy, salad was definitely a rip off. There was just nothing really great about the food, at all. Also, this place isn't family friendly in the least. They didn't have high chairs and the server got all pissy because we brought the stroller to the table so my daughter would have somewhere to sit.

The chicken is great quality and the chips great. They don't seem to have a ton of options, but (4 different meats + 2 extra meat choices with different seasonings + no meat) * 4 presentation choices does indeed add up to a lot of options. It's then accessorized to your liking. Great place for takeout or to sit in, especially on a nice day when the front windows are open and you can eat looking out over Broad Street. And they are super nice. If they just had desserts, my life - or at least my dining experience - would be complete.","predicted_text":"Positive"},{"name":"Buena Onda","text":"The fish tacos! The shrimp tacos! Amazing. But the carnitas--how do you mess up fried pork?! The carnitas taco was possibly the worst I've had, but it was easy to overlook once I chomped into a fried shrimp taco. It's awesome that they have Mexican coke, though it's a shame it's $3 a bottle. Makes me think: coke or another taco? Taco it is! For seafood tacos, this place is the best.","predicted_text":"Positive"},{"name":"Tacodelphia","text":"Those sauces, especially that red sauce, just wow. Illegal tacos has some great offerings, and there are some particular ingredients that you can tell they take a lot of time and care into making.\n\nTheir al pastor meat is just phenomenal, packing a ton of flavor, great texture and an absolutely perfect cook every time. Their two red sauces are also great, one is pretty spicy but continues to be flavorful, and the other is a more savory, almost fruity flavor that absolutely blew me away.\n\nI got both the burrito and the tacos and both I can highly recommend. Menu is a little small, but when each option is a hit that's not a problem. \nOrdering process is set up like other similar fast casual restaurants and seating is plentiful for even medium sized groups.\n\nThis place is in competition with some of the great authentic Mexican places further south, but makes a great option if you're west of Broad of north of South. Food is a great value for money, would highly recommend if you're in the area and craving some good taco's.","predicted_text":"Positive"},{"name":"Tacodelphia","text":"Just tried take out.

I've been there many times and endured the poor service, however this is a major health issue that cannot be overlooked.  The waiter didn't return after serving one of us a drink, so I grabbed another staff person who kindly took it back to the kitchen and returned with a lot of \"i'm so sorry this happened\" and \"this is unacceptable\" and \"what else can I get you\".

The quesadillas were prepared deep fried unlike most Mexican restaurants down here, and the enchiladas came with a spicy sauce that I need to buy in bulk.

I've recently joined their ranks, and have been enjoying it. So far, I've tried Quesadillas (Chicken & Al Pastor), a veggie burrito, and tacos. Everything is good, and the portion sizes are adequate. But that's about it, sometimes it honestly just feels... Adequate. I think there are better Mexican options out there (and even in the Spring Garden neighbourhood).\n\n Pretty standard as far as truck food goes.

I came for dinner on a Friday the weather was great so I went for the outdoor seating. Our waiter whom I think his name was Pablo was GREAT. He was super attentive, informative and really friendly. I start with an order of guacamole and chips and a pitcher of classic margarita mix. The guacamole was delicious the chips were overcooked and very hard. The margarita mix was great and it was free!!  \nI order the cochinita pibil and my bf ordered the mole poblano. My dish was not what I expected for $15.00. The pork had lots of fat. The flavor was light it could have used a little more. My entr\u00e9e came with rice, black refried beans and fried plantains.  The rice was plain and there wasn't much flavor and so for the beans. I think I have had better rice and beans at a tacqueria. I wasn't able to eat my plantain because after one bite I realized it was under cooked. No bueno! My bf's dish was highly disappointing as well. He dish consisted of a small piece of chicken breast over mole sauce with a side of their bland rice and bean.  I'm pretty confident I could have made theses entrees myself at home and better tasting. Overall each entr\u00e9e we ordered was a disappointment especially for the price.

Most of the menu items consist of meat. Even though their seitan dishes are quite satisfying, according to my carnivorous and vegetarian friends... The focus is mostly on the meat. It's all about da meat! But if something isn't perfectly catered to a vegetarian need, just chill... they try hard to meet your needs :D Try the interestingly cheesey side of corn!\n\n2) For all you real foodies out there, you know and can appreciate ECR's fine choice in ingredients. Everything is either fresh or homemade! You won't find any of that nasty canned crap in the kitchen. So um... for those who say otherwise,shhhh, just chill... have another bite and savor it. Try the beautifuly smoked wagyu brisket.\n\n3) The service might not be ECR's strong point. But cut them some slack... How many packed tables do you see? A LOT. All the folks there are way cool; trying their best to make everyones experience enjoyable! So call over your server, be patient, relax, just chill... enjoy good company! Try the Texas peach tea while your at it!\n\n4) For all you Top Chef fans... Guess who's going to be in season 6! None other than ECR's lovely executive chef, Jen Zavala! (definitely the hottest contestant in Sin City).\n\n5) Lastly... seasonal fruit cobbler... enough said.","predicted_text":"Positive"},{"name":"El Camino Real","text":"Meh.. thats really all there is to say.

I went after the lunch rush so only waited for five minutes, but would not give up my lunch hour to wait for this. I ordered the chicken satay tacos and they were terribly underwhelming. The chicken was fairly bland and dry compared to the satay chicken I've had in restaurants, and the toppings (cabbage, avocado and what looks like an aioli) do nothing to enhance a meh flavor profile. Sriracha helps but not enough to make it a winner, and since it's an add-on I think it should be delicious even without. \n\nThe whole dish needs more acid and seasoning - ginger, lime, pineapple, tomato - something! Grilling the chicken wouldn't hurt, either. I may go one more time to try the short rib tacos, but it won't be a priority. Two stars for the service, which was very kind, polite, and quick.\n\nI know that food trucks are about proximity more than anything, but Tacos Don Memo or Honest Tom's are far superior cheap University City taco experiences.

Mariah Carey?  Music choice aside, the place has a great atmosphere.  We were seated right away, although I must suggest that they not cram THAT many tables next to each other -- uncomfortable!

Sadly their drinks have also changed: gone many of the unique concoctions that I loved (such as the El Fumador).  Both the food and drink menus are decidedly uninspired.  The margaritas are good but (i though) a bit over-sweetened.  I have no complaints about the blood orange martini, however.  As for the food, it was just okay - the guac is more modestly portioned than it used to be and the appetizers (at least the ones we got) were bland. The Pollo Frito, supposedly this restaurant's signature dish, was tasty but lacked that out-of-this-world taste that you'd expect for a nearly 30-dollar entree.\n\nOur service was also lacking and I'm willing to chalk it up to an \"off night\", but when you're just not served two dishes that you've ordered it warrants mentioning.  Other tables' food was also brought to ours.  We received a dessert dish in lieu of the missing appetizer, but nothing was removed from the bill (nor offered to be).
